**Challenges of Using Monitors in Industrial Settings**

**Airborne Contaminants -** Floating dust, metal shavings, fiberglass and other particulate can quickly accumulate on exposed monitor screens and vents, leading to overheating failures. Accumulated debris also reduces visibility and requires frequent cleaning.

**Chemical Exposure -** Splashes or spills of solvents, oils and other chemicals can damage plastic monitor casings and corrode electronic components. Some chemicals can even dissolve monitor screens. Unprotected monitors are vulnerable to failure.

**Impacts -** Fast moving forklifts and heavy equipment make collisions inevitable. Even workers rushing to meet quotas can accidentally bump monitors. The jolts from vibrations and impacts loosen connections and disturb alignment.

**Restricted Visibility -** High shelves, tall machinery and stacked inventory severely limit sight lines. Viewing monitors above conveyors or through safety bars makes critical data hard to read. Poor positioning hampers monitoring.

**Changing Users -** With rotating shifts and varied assignments, a fixed monitor location limits who can utilize it. Workers have different heights and preferences, making adaptability ideal.

**Benefits of Sallas Industrial Monitor Mounts**

Sallas manufactures heavy-duty LCD monitor mounts designed to thrive in harsh settings.

**Durability -** Solid steel or aluminum construction gives Sallas mounts exceptional strength. Thick base plates provide stability even when loaded to maximum capacity. Powder coated and stainless steel finishes resist chemicals and scratches.

**Adjustability -** The multi-jointed arms offer an exceptionally wide range of motion, extending forward, backward, up and down for optimal visibility. Tilting and rotating capabilities allow precise screen positioning.

**Modularity -** Adhering to VESA mounting standards allows the mounts to accept most monitor brands. Quick-release connections let users rapidly swap monitors and accessories to suit immediate needs.

**Cable Management -** Integrated clips and channels neatly route cables along the arm. Keeping wires contained avoids tangled hazards while still allowing full arm articulation.

Ideal industrial monitor mounts offer these critical features:

**Robust Build -** Durable steel construction and heavy bases withstand vibrations and impacts. Polycarbonate shields protect against particulates embedding in screens.

**Chemical Resistance -** Powder coated and stainless steel surfaces resist damage from harsh solvents, cleaners or lubricants. Sealed openings prevent interior corrosion.

**Shock Absorption -** Gas cylinders, springs and padded joints help absorb the brunt of crashes to protect sensitive monitor components. Reinforced connections maintain alignment.

**Extended Reach -** Arms that can extend, contract, tilt, swivel and rotate through a full 180 degrees or more allow monitors to be placed in the optimal viewing position.
 
**Integrated Cable Management -** Channels built into the mount arms neatly route cables off desks and floors. Clip mounts keep cables firmly in place during arm movement.

**5 Ways to Create an Ergonomic Workspace with Monitor Mounts**

Properly positioned monitors play a crucial role in designing an ergonomic workspace. The right monitor mount provides flexibility to customize the workspace and minimize fatigue.

**Adjust Screen Height for Neutral Neck Posture**

Having screens too low or high forces uncomfortable neck and back hunching or straining. Monitor mounts with height adjustment allow positioning the screenâ€™s top at eye level to maintain a neutral gaze angle. This prevents soreness from constant looking up or down.

**Reduce Eyestrain with Optimized Viewing Distance**

Extendable monitor mounts make it easy to position screens at the ideal 18 to 30 inches for reduced eyestrain. At proper distance, eyes can relax rather than straining to focus. Adjustability enables personalized setups.

**Minimize Glare for Improved Visibility**

Glare on glossy monitors causes squinting and headaches. Monitor mounts allow tilting screens to eliminate overhead lighting glare. Swivel adjustments can also redirect reflections from windows or overhead lights.

**Promote Good Posture with Independent Adjustments**

Quality mounts enable tweaking monitor and keyboard positions independently. Adjust keyboard height separately from monitor height to optimize elbow angles and open the shoulders.

**Keep Frequently Used Items Within Reach**

Monitor mounts with attachment accessories like shelves and trays allow keeping phones, tablets, documents and tools close at hand. Consolidating items in the work zone reduces reaching that strains the back.

Proper ergonomics enhance comfort, prevent injury, and boost productivity. Monitor mounts provide the flexibility to tailor the workspace and maintain healthy postures. Investing in adjustability creates an optimal environment. Rugged monitor mounts engineered specifically for industrial environments optimize monitor visibility and usability while saving valuable workspace. Sallas' adjustable, durable monitor arms are built to withstand the most demanding conditions and maximize productivity.
